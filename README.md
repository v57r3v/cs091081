INTRODUCTION
The   term   ‘organic’, in   common   usage   refers   to   the   products   of   agriculture and farming that are produced according to particular   methods   of   fertilisation   and   pest   control.


In   chemistry, the   term   organic   refers   to   the   study   of   compounds   of carbon (excluding CO, CO2    and the carbonates). Organic chemistry was   once   referred   to   as   the   chemistry   of   ‘living   things’ and   it   was   thought that organic compounds could not be synthesised in a   laboratory because   they   all   contained   a ‘vital force’. The synthesis of   urea by Fredrick Wholer in   1828 proved that organic   compounds   could be manufactured   and   there   are   now   millions   of   different   organic   compounds   known, with   new   ones   discovered each year. Organic compounds are found in   living   organisms,   fossil   fuels   such   as   coal   and   petroleum, and many common products such as soap, plastics, paper, cosmetics and medicines.
Carbon is unique among the elements in its ability to form   chains, branched   chains   and rings   of   carbon   atoms of   an almost unlimited size and variety. It is   able to   form   4   stable bonds with   itself   and   other atoms, predominately hydrogen but also oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus and the halogens.
HYDROCARBONS
The simplest organic compounds contain only carbon   and hydrogen   and   are   called   hydrocarbons.   There   are   3 groups   of   hydrocarbons:
•             Alkanes –molecules that have only single bonds between the   carbon   atoms.   They   are   said to   be   saturated   because   they   have   the   maximum   number   of   hydrogen   atoms   possible   for   the   given number   of   carbon   atoms.
•             Alkenes –molecules with one or more double bond between the   carbon   atoms.   They   are   said   to be   unsaturated because it is possible to add hydrogen atoms to them
•             Alkynes   –molecules   with   one   or   more   triple   bonds   between   the   carbon   atoms.   This   class   of compounds is also unsaturated.
ALKANES
Alkanes are the simplest organic compounds and   can be regarded   as the   “parents” of   all   other   organic   compounds.   Since a carbon atom must form. four covalent bonds to   either   itself   or   other   atoms,   the simplest hydrocarbon will therefore have the formula CH4.
CH4   is known as methane and methane molecules have the following Lewis diagram   and   structure:

Methane is a colourless, odourless gas that is the main component   of   “Natural   Gas” which   we burn   for   fuel. It is a “greenhouse gas’ which, along with   carbon   dioxide, makes   a   significant   contribution   to global warming.
Methane is the first of   the alkane family of   hydrocarbons. When   a   second   carbon is   introduced to the molecule we need 6 hydrogen atoms to satisfy the bonding requirements of   the carbon   atoms.   The compound has the molecular formula C2H6   and is called ethane.


In organic chemistry it is usual to use a structural   formula rather than   the   molecular   formula.   However,   it is convenient to condense the structural formula   so that   all the bonds to hydrogen   are   not   shown,   while still retaining the carbon to carbon framework. This gives   the   condensed   structural   formula   for   ethane as   CH3CH3.
When   a   third   carbon   atom   is   introduced, the   compound   is   known   as   propane.
Molecular formula: C3H8                                                             Condensed structural formula: CH3CH2CH3
Structural formula:   
The four carbon alkane, C4H10,   is known as butane. The   five   carbon   alkane,   C5H12,   is   pentane.   If   we keep adding carbon atoms to the chain we can develop   a   series   of   molecules that   differ by   a   –CH2-         group.
Butane:    CH3CH2CH2CH3, Pentane: CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Table 7.1                        The First Ten Unbranched Hydrocarbons
All the alkanes can be represented using the general formula CnH2n+2    where n represents some   integer.
As the length of   the hydrocarbon chain increases it is sometimes more   convenient   to   summarise   the number   of   CH2   groups; pentane   could   be   written   as   CH3(CH2)3CH3    and   decane   as   CH3(CH2)8CH3.   The naming of   these straight chain alkanes is relatively simple. Apart   from the   first   four   members   of   the   series, the name is either a Greek or Latin prefix indicating the number   of   carbon atoms   in   these   molecules and this is followed by the ending   -ane.
(Hint: To remember the order of   the names for the first four hydrocarbons you   could use the mnemonic: Must Eat Peanut Butter)

6.          What is the   shape   of   the bonding   around   each   C   atom   in   an   alkane?   Give   a reason   for your   answer.
Straight Chains,   Branched Chains, and   Rings   in AlkanesThe molecules in Table 7.1 are all examples   of   so-called   straight   chain   alkanes – each   carbon   atom   (except for those at the two ends of   the chain)   is connected to   two   other   carbon   atoms.   In   branched-   chain alkane molecules some of   the carbon atoms are   attached   to more than two   other   carbon   atoms.
For example,

A count of   the atoms will show that branched-chain alkanes   still have   the   general   formula   CnH2n+2   .   A   branched chain molecule is considered to have a ‘long’ chain to which   ‘side’ chains   are   attached.   Side      chains are are known as alkyl groups. An   alkyl   group   is   formed by removing   one hydrogen   atom   from   an alkane and is named by replacing the –ane ending with    -yl. Thus   CH3-   is methyl-   from methane,   CH3CH2- is ethyl- from ethane, CH3CH2CH2- is propyl,   etc. The   significance   of   “group”   is   that   it refers   to a cluster of   atoms that are a part of   a molecule,   where the   cluster   cannot   exist   on   its   own.

Table 7.2                               Names of   some side chains
In cycloalkanes, three or more carbon   atoms are   linked together   in   a ring.   Ring   sizes   can be up to   30   or   more carbon atoms.
For example:
   
Structurally, the differenc代 写CHEM 191 MODULE 7 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 1SQL
代做程序编程语言e between a straight chain alkane   and a   cycloalkane   is   the   absence   of   one   hydrogen atom from each end of   the   straight chain.   Consequently, the   general   formula   for   any cycloalkane   is   CnH2n.
When drawing structural diagrams for complex structures,   including   cycloalkanes, the   C   and   H   atoms   are not explicitly written. Instead, a line diagram is used,   in which   the   C-C bonds   are   shown   as   lines with the end of   each line being a CH, CH2    or   CH3    as required   for the   structure to be neutral.
For example:

ISOMERISM
In inorganic chemistry, with very few exceptions, the molecular formula of   a compound uniquely   identifies that compound. For organic compounds, the molecular formula is rarely unique. Different   compounds with the same molecular formula but a different arrangement of   atoms   are   said to be   isomers of   each other.   Structural or constitutional isomers arise when the   same   atoms   can be connected together in different ways. For all hydrocarbons larger than propane, there is more than   one way in which the carbon atoms can be interconnected.
Butane   (C4H10) has   two   isomers:

The second of   these two isomers is an example   of   a   branched chain isomer while   the   first   is known   as   a   straight   chain   isomer.
Pentane (C5H12) has three isomers:

Isomers have different boiling points, freezing points, and densities. The existence of   isomers   is   one   of    the   reasons   for   the   vast   number   of   organic   compounds. As   the   number   of   carbon   atoms   is   increased, the number   of   possible   isomers   increases   rapidly   – C8H18    has   18 possible   isomers, C20H42   has 366319 isomers and C40H82    has an estimated 6.25 ×   1013    possible isomers.

Naming   Branched-Chain Alkanes
An   international   set   of   rules   has   been   developed   by   the   International   Union   of   Pure   and   Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) for naming organic compounds. The name will indicate the number   of   carbon   atoms in the molecule, the way these are arranged and, when atoms   other than   hydrogen   and   carbon   are   involved,where   these   are   attached   and   in   what   order.
The IUPAC name for a straight chain   alkane   consists   of:
•            a   prefix   which   shows   the   number   of   carbons
•          the suffix –ane which   shows the hydrocarbon belongs to   the   alkane   family   (see   Table   7.1).
For branched-chain isomers we need to show:
•          The   parent   name   which   is   the   longest   chain   of   carbon   atoms
•          The substituents or branches (sometimes known   as   side   chains)   and their position   on   the parent   chain.
To name a molecule:
1. Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms (the parent chain).
2. Number each carbon of the parent chain, starting from whichever end of the chain gives the lowest numbers to carbon atoms substituted with the branches or side chains.
3. Identify the alkyl group(s)which forms the side chain(s)
4. Prefix the name of the side chain(s) to the name of the parent chain and identify the number(s) of the carbon atom(s) to which it is attached
Example   1:    To name the molecule:

1.    Identify the longest continuous chain of   carbon atoms   in   the   structure   and   let   this be   the   parent   chain.
•          There are 6 molecules in the   longest   chain   so the parent   chain   is   hexane.
(Note that for simplicity in this and in the following   examples, the molecules have been
represented with the longest chain in a straight line but this   is   not   a   requirement,   nor   will   it   always be the case.)
2.    Number each carbon of   the parent chain, starting from whichever   end   of   the   chain   gives   the   lower number to carbon atom with the branches or side   chains.

•          Had we numbered from right to left, the   side chain carbon   atom   would have been number   4.
3.    Identify the alkyl group which   forms the branch
•          In this case it   is   a   methyl   group   (as   it has   only   1   carbon   atom)
4.    Prefix   the   name   of   the   side   chain   to   the   name   of   the   parent   chain   and   identify   the   number   of   the carbon atom to which it is   attached.
•          The   correct   name   is   3-methylhexane.
Note: There are no spaces between the two parts of   the name and   the   location number   is   separated   from   the name by a hyphen.
Example 2. What if   there is more than one   side   chain?
To name the molecule:

1.    Parent   chain = heptane
2.    Number the parent carbon chain from the end which gives   the   lowest   sum   for the   carbons   on   which   the side chains   are   found.
•          In the example above, there are two   options – numbering   from the   left, the   side   chains   would be   on carbons 3 and 6 (3 +   6 =   9). Numbering   from the   right   the   side   chains would be   on   carbons   2   and 5 (2 + 5 =7).    Numbering   from the right   gives the   lowest   sum.

3.    Alkyl groups are: methyl on carbon   2   and   ethyl   (2   carbon   chain)   on   carbon   5.
4.    The   alkyl   group   prefixes   areplaced   in   alphabetic   order   with   hyphens   used   to   separate   numbers   from letters.
The correct name is 5-ethyl-2-methylheptane.
NOTE – The structure in Example 2 was drawn with the parent chain in a straight line. However, you should always check whether there is a longer chain that includes a group that has been drawn as a side chain.
For example – the way the following molecule is drawn the longest chain goes through the side chain.

Example 3.    What if   there are two or more identical   side chains?
We use di- for two tri- for three, tetra- for four,   penta- for   5   etc.to   indicate   identical   side   chains.
To name the molecule:

Name is: 2,5-dimethylheptane.
Note: These scaling prefixes do not affect the   alphabetic   order triethyl   still   comes before methyl.
Example 4. What if   identical groups are on the   same carbon?
Where identical groups are on the same carbon   atom,   repeat the number   of   this   carbon   in the   name.
To name the molecule:

Naming Cyclic Alkanes
If   there is a ring present, it becomes the parent no matter how long the side-chains might be.    The parent name is prefixed by cyclo, and numbering starts at the lowest alphabetic   group   and proceeds   in the direction which gives the lowest overall set   of   numbers.
Example: To name the compound:      

Name is:   1,2-dimethylcyclohexane (not   1,6-dimethylcyclohexane or 5,6-dimethylcyclohexane or any   other   combination).
Summary
• Alkyl groups are listed in alphabetic order, ignoring any scaling prefixes
• If there is any ambiguity, numbers are used to identify the carbon atoms to which alkyl side chains are attached.
• Numbers are separated from numbers by commas, numbers are separated from letters by hyphens.
• There are no spaces between letters
